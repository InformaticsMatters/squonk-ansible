# Encryption of sensitive data (Ansible Vault)
To run the playbooks you will need the [Ansible Vault] Password,
which can be found in **KeePass** (Under **Squonk Ansible > Ansible Vault Password**).

You can either put the password in the `vault-pass.txt` file in the project
root (protested from commit by `.gitignore`) or present it on the
command-line when you run the playbooks.

## Encrypted variables (parameters)
Parameters are stored in vault-encrypted files and these can be used by Ansible
directly. You can expect a vault file for each deployment, identified
at run-time by the variable `sq_parameter_vault`. Vault files can be edited
in-situ while preserving the encrypted state of the file.

Armed with the repo's vault password you can edit any encrypted
parameter file with: -

    $ IM_VAULT=im-demo
    $ ansible-vault edit roles/squonk/vars/${IM_VAULT}-parameters.vault
